    "Before modelling, we will first split the data into the train and test sets. This ensures that that we do not violate one of the golden rules of machine learning: never use the test set for training. As EDA can help guide the choice and form of model, we also may want to split the data before EDA, to avoid peeking at the test data too much during this phase. However, in practice, we may need to investigate the entire data during EDA to get a better idea on how to handle issues such as missingness, categorical data (and rare categories), incorrect data, etc.      \n",

You can have a look at the documentation: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html. Note that `train_test_split` defaults to randomly sampling the data to split it into training and validation/test sets, that is, the default value is `shuffle=True`  \n",

This ensures that, every step including randomness, will produce the same output if we re-run the code or if someone else wants to reproduce our results (e.g. produce the same train-test split).\n",

    "In `sklearn`, the suggestion to control randomness across multiple consecutive executions is as follows: \n",

    "- In order to obtain reproducible (i.e. constant) results across multiple program executions, we need to remove all uses of `random_state=None`, which is the default.\n",

When we over fit a polynomial regression model, the MSE for the training data will appear to be low which might indicate that the model is a good fit. But, as a result of over fitting, the MSE for the predictions of the unseen test data may begin to increase. However, we can **NOT** use the test to determine the order of the polynomial, so in the following, we explore using cross-validation to do so."
